# Landscape Overview & Master Matrix

**Scope:** every player researched in this pack, mapped across both axes (AI-OS experience + AI company/workforce) plus infra references, with a master capability matrix and the white-space call-out. Full per-player detail (with ≥5 sources each) lives in docs `10`–`31`; this doc is the map. Synthesis lives in `40`–`46`.

## The categorized map

```
AXIS A — AI-OS EXPERIENCE (foreground, what the user sees)
  Consumer "AI OS":   Warmwind(10) · Flowith(11) · Rabbit(15) · /dev/agents→Meta(14) · Genspark(15) · Manus(15)
  Real device OS (Cat-1): Aluminium/Google(12) · Brain Natural OS(13)

AXIS B — AI COMPANY / WORKFORCE (background, the org doing the work)
  "AI software company" frameworks: MetaGPT · ChatDev · CrewAI · AutoGen/AG2 · LangGraph · AgentVerse (20)
  Enterprise AI workforce:          ServiceNow · Salesforce Agentforce · Microsoft Agent 365 · Google Gemini Enterprise (21)
  AI-employee startups:             Relevance AI · Lindy · Artisan · 11x · Cognosys · Sierra · Cognition/Devin (22)

INFRA / ARCHITECTURE (the plumbing, mine for patterns — not rivals)
  VAST · AIOS(Rutgers) · Agno AgentOS · Letta/MemGPT (30)

VERTICAL agentic-OS (proof the framing goes per-domain)
  Legora(legal) · NickAI(trading) · Harvey(legal) · Imbue (31)
```

The three meanings of "OS" (real device OS · AI-agent experience layer · infra/kernel-for-agents) are explained in `40`. **We are the AI-agent experience layer (Cat-2) with consumer ambition, built on a reused Linux kernel.**

## Master capability matrix

Rows alphabetical. Columns use the full-vision yardstick. Legend: ✅ shipped/strong · ◑ partial/feature-level · ✗ none/undisclosed. Every value traces to the cited per-player doc; confidence and sources are in those docs.

## White-space call-out

Reading the matrix top to bottom, the empty columns are the story:

1. **Chairman (P2): a column of ✗.** No player seats the human atop the org. *Uncontested.*
2. **Runtime recursion to a one-task leaf (P1): nobody.** Deepest is author-time nesting (LangGraph) or fixed roles (MetaGPT) (`20`).
3. **PQC (P4): a column of ✗ in our category.** Only the device OS below us (Aluminium) has it (`12`, `41`).
4. **Independent verifier with veto (T1): nobody.** Closest are in-loop ensembles (Genspark/Manus) or an enterprise feature (MS Critique) — none is a standing employee with block authority (`42`).
5. **Personal + sovereign + trusted, together (P5): being vacated**, not just empty (/dev/agents→Meta, Cognosys→Cohere) (`14`, `22`).

The union of these five is the wedge. Full argument in `43-full-vision-match.md`; positioning in `44`.

## How to read the rest of the pack

- **Per-player deep dives + SWOT + facts tables:** `10`–`15` (Axis A), `20`–`22` (Axis B), `30`–`31` (infra/vertical).
- **Synthesis:** `40` (OS fundamentals), `41` (security+quantum), `42` (trust), `43` (the crux), `44` (positioning), `46` (executive roster).
- **Next step:** `45` (the one-at-a-time interview, after you read this).
- **Internal self-audit to read alongside:** root [`SWOT.md`](../../SWOT.md).
